< p > in here is a tag. The below text is enclosed in paragraph tags:

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>

Attributes can contain extra information about the element, but these don't appear in the page content:

<p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>

You can nest elements:

<p class="editor-note">My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy</p>

Some elements have no content and are called void elements. The img element is one of those. Also note there is no closing img tag and no inner content.

<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
