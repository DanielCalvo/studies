# 2. What Is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It?
- Typescript is a Javascript superset. It makes writing JS easier and more powerful
- TS cannot be executed by JS environments. Browsers can't execute typescript.

- TS is a compiler to compile your code to JS (ooooo) but you didn't write JS, you wrote TS, with new features!
- You can write nicer and easier code with TS that will then be compiled to JS

- TS adds types! So you can identify errors before your script runs. It gives you extra error checking!
- You can avoid type problems in functions (ex: a sum function could try to sum two strings)
