## 58. What are classes?
- OOP theory, hah.

## 69. Abstract classes
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, they're just there so that they can be inherited from
- Inheriting classes must provide the concrete implementation following the structure you laid out in the parent class

eh, watch this again!

## 70 Singletons & abstract constructors
- Singleton: When you only want to have one instance of a class

## 72. A first interface
- An interface describes the structure of an object (huh?)
- Interfaces have no implementation details at all (unlike abstract classes, which can have!)
