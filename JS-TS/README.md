You stopped on lecture 50! Logical errors!
Uh-oh there's a lecture on a debugger coming, noice!

Other resources:
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- Software system design by example: https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/introduction/ 

# Where you stopped
- Continue with your write to file try/catch/finally saga on exception_handling.js

# Things to figure out
- Maybe give webstorm a try or vscode
    - dang you can see variable values
    - and you can run arbitrary code at a breakpoint, so cool 
- Debugging on vscode is excellent, you should find an alternative in the jetbrains world, or pick up webstorm
- Read about objects on the mozila mdn docs
- Have a cursory look at array functions
- Dive a bit deeper into functions and their structures in JS
- How do you write a test for a function?
    - Looks like jest is a good place to look for: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started 
- Write something that takes an anonymous function as parameter so you can familiarize yourself more with it!
- What's up with the .then thing?
- Can you dive deeper on what is a callback function in Javascript? 

- How do I return an error in a function in JS, goland style? Like say I have a function that tries to write to a file but can't, how do you write/handle that?
- What does 'use strict' in JS do?

- What's up with the `alert` thing/function and why doesn't it work out of the box?

- Try learning more about writing to files. I think you'll learn interesting things going down that route and you'll understand try/catch/finally/better
