# Overall notes:

## Section 2 
Setting up a new project:
```shell
npm init
npm install --save-dev lite-server
npm start
```

## Section 3
- Your understanding of function calling functions is poor. Apparently there's a difference between functions and arrow functions?
- More on types available here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html

## Section 4 
- Got confused on what functions are doing again on the rest parameters lecture. Typescript is different in this regard from other languages I know

## Section 5
- The whole class and copying from a class using `this` is also a bit confusing
