- Do Todd's mongodb thing with the packages thing he does, maybe you can learn something
    - Write down instructions on how to create, update and delete a user, it's a bit unclear how to do that looking at the code
- Then do the exercises he suggests! (hold it in a map in memory, hold it in a json file, see what else)
