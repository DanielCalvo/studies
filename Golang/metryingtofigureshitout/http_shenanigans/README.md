- Following this really cool example
- https://dev.to/moficodes/build-your-first-rest-api-with-go-2gcj

#### Breaking this down
- Find a way to handle the routing
- Find a way to add an item
- Find a way to retrieve an item with a given attribute (such as a name)
- Find a way to delete an item
- Find a way to list the items
- How are you going to store your data? SQL? MongoDB?

### Ideas
- First of all: Re-read the example posted 
- Write something that receives a POSTed JSON, print it on screen
- Save this posted JSON to this
- Find a way to list all saved to disk JSONs

### Ideas for later
- Investigate saving and retrieving the data to/from MongoDB
- Deploy this on AWS behind an API Gateway
- Can you make this run on Lambda?

### Ok but what does this actual thing do
- Receive the status of a job

### Other ideas
- Image resizer
- HTTP encrypt service that uses it's own keys you can't access (Google: Open source alternative to KMS)
