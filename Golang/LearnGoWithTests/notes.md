## Chapter 1
Writing a test is just like writing a function, with a few rules: 
- It needs to be in a file with a name like xxx_test.go
- The test function must start with the word Test
- The test function takes one argument only t *testing.T
- In order to use the *testing.T type, you need to import "testing"
