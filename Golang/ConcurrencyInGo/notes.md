### Chapter 3:
####Exercises you can do to solidify your knowledge:
- Create a program with two go routines: On that adds to a queue and another one that consumes from a queue
- Create a go routing that can signal other go routines to stop (like a supervisor-type-thing)
- How can you pass functions as arguments to other functions again?
- I don't understand how example 26 works at all. I think I need to further investigate the select statement.

### Chapter 4:
- What is a Go generator?
- Ok I saw a generator. But why would you use a generator? :o
- "A generator for a pipeline is any function that converts a set of discrete values into a stream of values on a channel"
- Tee channel is missing
- Perhaps google "google channel pattern examples" for some clearer examples.
- Have a look at the context package again
