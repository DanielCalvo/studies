# Problems tackled
## Add two numbers
- [add_two_numbers](./add_two_numbers): Goes through a linked list and sums numbers in reverse order
- Learned about: Linked lists, pointers and the "revert number digits" trick, AND READING THE PROBLEM PROPERLY BEFORE GOING ON LIKE 10 UNRELATED TANGENTS GOOD LORD DANIEL
## Atoi
- Converts a string to number
- Learned about: Bitwise (a bit -- ha!), ASCII value tables (c - '0' trick), table tests, debugging with Goland (cool!) and struggled a bit with programming in general. Gotta get better!


# Other notes
- [./search_insert_position](./search_insert_position) is not O(log n) -- I think it needs a divide and conquer algorithm but I haven't formally studied those!
