# Chapter 14: Managing Incidents
- Unmanageged incidents can get very messey very fast as people act in an uncoordinated fashion

## Elements of Incident Management Process
This is all based on a FEMA thing, interesting

## Separation of responsabilities
Its important everyone knows their role
- Incident commander: Holds state about incident, structure the incident task force, assigning responsabilities according to needs and priorities
- Operational Workers: The people responding to the incident and performing technical work. This should be the only group modifying the system during an incident!
- Communicator: The one who issues updates to stakeholders (customers, managers, VPs, etc)
- Planner: Supports Ops with things like filling bugs, ordering pizza, arranging handoffs and tracking the system. Eh, this one seems a bit optional

It's important that there's a single, dedicated channel to talk about the incident. Like a Slack or IRC channel!

Keeping the state of the incident somewhere (ex: A wiki, or slack) and being able to handle over incident to people in other timezones are also important.

## Have a command post!
- Coordinate over either IRC/slack channel or something for the incident

## When to declate an incident
If any of this is true:
- Do you need help of another team fixing the problem?
- Is this outage visible to customers?
- Is the issue unsolved even after an hour or analysis?

There's a "Best practices for incident management" chart at the end of the chapter that makes sense but I feel doesn't present any remarkable information.
