# Chapter 13: Emergency Response
Keep calm. Take a deep breath. It'all be okay!
- Make sure you're familiar with the incident respose process, if there is one!
- Keep a history of outages so you can learn from them
- Encourage proactive testing. It's best to have a failure when everyone is online and not on a Sunday at 2am
