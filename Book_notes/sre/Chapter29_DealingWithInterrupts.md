# Chapter 29 - Dealing with Interrupts
- Google recommends that if you're going to be handling interrupts, do that only (pages, tickets, slack, etc)
- You can't be in the zone (aka flow) if you're being interrupted all the time. However, if your job is 100% interrupts, you can get in the zone for that too!
- Book says: Do one thing well. Project time and interrupts at the same time don't mix.

- Limit context switches. Do just project work or just interrupts for a week, a day or half a day

- The book encourages you to attempt to find a root cause to some of your tickets to see if you can fix the problem, instead of doing tickets dealing with the symptoms.

Respect yourself and your customers
- If tickets are onerous or annoying, it's okay to push back some of the effort onto your customers. Strike a balance between respecting your customer and yourself.
- Maybe you need to support a flaky tool that's annoying. If you don't get a lot of help, maybe the tool isn't important.
- If dealing with an interrupt doesn't require privileges, consider using policy to push the request back to the requestor. Instruct the customer to perform the step and send you back for review. If a customer wants a certain task accomplished, it's okay for them to spend some effort getting what they want.
- I like this part: "Your guiding principle in constructing a strategy for dealing with customer requests is that the request should be meaningful, be rational, and provide all the information and legwork you need in order to fulfill the request. In return, your response should be helpful and timely"
