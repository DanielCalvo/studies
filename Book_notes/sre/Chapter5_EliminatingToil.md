## Chapter 5: Elimitating Toil
Toil: Work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, devoid of enduring value and that scales linearly as the service grows

## So what qualifies as engineering
- Software engineering: Writing or modifying code, in addition to design and documentation work
- Systems engineering: Configuring production systems in a way that produces lasting improvements

Toil isn't always bad, but too much toil can be bad.

## Why too much toil is bad
- Career stagnation: You won't learn much
- Low morale: Toil is really boring and will make you bored
- Confusion: Might send the wrong messages to other team, do we just do toil?
- Slow progress: If we just do toil, we don't do project work
- Sets precedent: To take even more toil!
- Promotes attrition: People will leave!
- Causes breach of faith: New joiners won't like all the toil

Commit to eliminate a bit of toil every week!
