# Chapter 10: Practical Alerting from Time Series Data
- This goes over Borgmon (which is very similar to Prometheus but doesn't seem practical at all!)
- One takeaway: You can alert things that threaten your SLO.
- Also use a combination of whitebox and blackbox monitoring as whitebox can't catch everything (ex: network failures causing metrics to get collected)
- This entire chapter could've been replaced with "Go read Prometheus Up And Running"
