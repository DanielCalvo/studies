# Chapter 15: Postmortem culture: Learning from Failure
Goals of a postmortem:
- Ensure that the incident is documented
- That the root causes are well understood
- And that preventive actions are in place to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of reoccurrence

For a postmortem to be blameless, it must focus on identifying the contributing causes of an incident without blaming any individual/team for bad behaviour

## Collaborate and share knowledge
Post mortems are meant to be collaborative!
- Maybe write the postmortem on a notion/confluence page together over a videocall

Post mortems are meant to be reviewed! This section has a list of things to review on a post mortem, have a look at them again if you need a refresher.

## Postmortems are a cultural thing!
To help adopt post mortems:
- Ease post mortems into the workflow -- trial out a few ones
- Make sure writing effective postmortems is rewarded and celebrated
- Encourage senior leadership's acknowledgement and participation
