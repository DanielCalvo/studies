I skimmed this one. You probably could get a lot of value from this book if you mapped how to implement the concepts it offers to concrete actions at $job.

## Chapter 3: Measuring and changing culture
The chart of pathological, bureaucratic, the cultures is really cool. Can you think of examples about generative culture question. High Corporation could be an example project to deploy services. For an example of how to configure monitoring. Airline
Messengers trained could be an example of incident postmortems.
on page 33 there is a really nice chart with agree and disagree statements for measuring culture.

## Chapter 4: Technical practices
- All about continous delivery. CD all the things! Describes benefits of CD and the parts of it that might need focus.

- Version Control
- Deployment automation
- Continuous integration
- Trunk based development
- Test Automation
- Test data management
- Shift Left on security
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Empowered teams
- Monitoring
- Active notification

All of the above are part of the path for continuous delivery

## Chapter 7: Management practices for software
Page 78 has some interesting Insight on lightweight change management processes. A Change review board is negatively correlated with performance. Interesting. Looks like this is something you can share at work.
