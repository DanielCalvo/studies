#Part I: Balancing People

## Chapter 1: The ultimate dichotomy
- Care about the people, but remember you're here to execute a mission
- The business example is a regional manager who has to fire people to keep the business going. If he fails to fire a few people, the entire business is at risk. It is a difficult decision

## Chapter 2: Own it all, but empower others
- Extreme ownership must be ballanced with decentralized command
- Leave something for others to own
- Enabling decentralized command allows you to look up instead of looking down
- Too much micromanagement: Lack of initiative, no action unless directed, not seeking solutions to problems, bold action is rare, no creativity, passivity
- Too much of a hands-off approach: Lack of vision, lack of coordination, failure to coordinate, wrong priorities, too many people trying to lead

Find the balance between decentralized command and extreme ownership

## Chapter 3: Resolute but not overbearing
- Know when to hold the line: Programming the rad ios in the seal teams was important. You have to know what matters and insist on it so that the team performance's is not subpar.
- Letting the team wear patches enhanced team morale and was let slide 
- Leadership capital: Finite amount of power a leader posesses. It is adquired over time with trust. If you spend your leadership capital on unimportant things, you wont have any left for important things 
- The most important explanation a leader can give to a team is why
- Don't sweat the small stuff

## Chapter 4: When to mentor, when to fire
- Poor Rock :(

# Part II: Balancing the mission

## Chapter 5: Train hard, but train smart
- There is no growth in the comfort zone
- If training is too easy and doesn't stretch the capabilities of the participants, their improvement will be minimal
- If training overwhelms the participants to the point where they can no longer function, it diminishes the lessons they can learn
- There will always be lessons to be learned. Best teams embrace those lessons, acknowledge the problems, and figure out ways to solve them. Bad teams reject criticism and say training was too hard
- Balance in training is important. Hard training is essential, but it's important to train smart
- Protip: It's up to you to develop a training program. You know your challenges way better than senior leadership does.

## Chapter 6: Aggressive, not reckless
- Problems aren't going to solve themselves. A leader must get aggressive and take action to solve them and implement a solution.
- A good deal won't close itself. The enemy isn't going to back off. Changes and new methodologies won't implement themselves. You need to aggressively implement them
- The best teams, the best leaders don't wait to act. Understanding the strategic vision, they overcome obstacles, capitalize on oportunities, accomplish the mission and win
- The dichotomy is that sometimes hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so he can properly react to it. A moment of consideration might reveal the enemy's true intentions
- The disease of victory: When a few successes produce an overconfidence in your abilities while underestimating the oponent
    - It is the leader's duty to fight against this so that despite success, he never gets complacent  
- The dichotomy between aggression and caution must be balanced. Be agressive, but never reckless.

## Chapter 7: Disciplined, not rigid
- While displine is a powerful tool for personal and team development, excessive discipline can stiffle free thinking
- When facing a mission or a task, a team can follow standard procedures instead of having to create a plan from scratch every time
- But there must be balance: Some teams or leaders can put too much focus on standard procedures
    - Processes that are too strict will inhibit people's willingness and ability to think
- Disciplined procedures must be balanced with the ability to apply common sense to an issue. Freedom to think about alternatives, new solutions, and make adjustments based on the reality of what's happening
    - If discipline is too strict, teams cannot make adjustments, adapt and user their most precious asset: their brains. They must be able to quickly develop customized solutiosn to problems for when the standard solution might not work
- You must carefully balance the strict discipline of standard procedure with the freedom to adapt and do what's best to achieve victory. Be disciplined, but not rigid

## Chapter 8: Hold people accountable, but don't hold their hands
- Accountability is an important tool leaders must utilize. But it should not be the primary tool
- Accountability must be balanced with other tools, such as making sure other people understand the why, empowering subordinates, and trusting that they will do the right thing without supervision, because they understand the importance of doing so
- When it comes to standards, it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate
- If someone is not performing to a standard, despite knowing why, the impact on the mission, and knowing ownership, the leader must hold the line. 
    - Drill down and micromanage tasks in order to get the person back on track. But the leader cannot stay there until they have a better understanding of the why.
    - A leader cannot stay there indefinitely. A leader must also look up and out -- toward senior leadership and the strategic mission to build relationships and influence strategic decisions
    
# Part 3: Balancing yourself

## Chapter 9: A leader and a follower
- Every leader must be willing and able to lead, but also to follow
- A leader must be willing to lean on the expertise and ideas of others for the good of the team
- A good leader encourages junior leaders to step up and lead when they put up ideas that contribute to mission sucsess
- A good leader must be a good follower of his leaders. One of the most important jobs of a leader is to support your own boss. A leader must follow and support the chain of command mik
- A good relationship with your boss incorporates 3 things: They trust you. They seek and value your opinion and guidance. They give you what you need to accomplish your mission and then let you go execute

## Chapter 10: Plan, but don't overplan
- Careful planning is essential to the success of any mission
- But you cannot plan for every contigency. Focusing on every possible potential problem will overwhelm your team, the planning process and complicate decisions for leaders
- Choose maybe 3-4 contigencies for each step along with the worst possible case scenario
- Be careful if you don't plan for contingencies also. Complacency and overconfidence are dangerous. A string of victories can breed arrogance

##Chapter 11: Humble, not passive
- Humility is the most important quality in a leader. When seals were fired, it was most often because they couldn't check their ago, refused constructive criticism, or take ownership for their mistakes
- But being too humble can be disastrous. Leaders often took this too far and became passive
- When it truly matters, leaders must be willing to push back, voice their concerns, stand up for the good of the team and provide feedback up the chain of command against a strategy they know will endanger the team or harm the strategic mission
- An important part of being a leader is being humble to see beyond his or her own needs. Understand the importance of strategic direction from your boss
- A leader must carefully prioritize when and where to push back. You may only be successful pushing back if you build a strong working relationship with your chain of command. Doing seemingly small things well can help you build this trust
- Leif strengthened the relationship with an army captain by carrying sandbags. This showed humility and that that they didn't hold themselves above carrying sandbags.

## Chapter 12: Focused, but detached
- Leaders must be attentive to the details. But they can't be so immersed in the details that they lose track of the larger strategic situation
- You also can't get so far away -- so detached -- that you lose track of what's happening in the front lines
- If you don't know what's going on, you can't lead
    - You can't try to be on top of everything, as you'll get sucked into all the minor things
    - You can't be be too far detached as you won't know what's going on
- If the team is on the verge of disaster, it's the for the senior leader to put detachment aside and lean into the fray to try to solve problems, it's time to lead.
- Pro tip for yourself: Don't run the risk of giving small things too much importance. Detach and think about it later with a broader point of view

## Afterword
- There are endless dichotomies out there. Communication. Humor. Emphasis on feelings. Emphasis on data. Work and personal life. You must find balance in all of them.
- Once balance is achieved, be aware that it will not last. Teams change. You change. The world changes.
- If you go out of balance, be careful not to over correct
