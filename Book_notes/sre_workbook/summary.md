## Chapter 2 - Implementing SLOs
- It was hard to see a way forward with this one. The theory is good, but it's hard to see how to implement these on a startup
- Maybe doing a project from scratch and implementing a SLO could help you understand the usability of this
- HmMmMmm maybe you can offer a SLO on your platform that you provide as infra?
