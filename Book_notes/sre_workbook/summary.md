- Would be nice to have a "key takeaways" from each chapter

# Part I - Foundations
- Basic foundations of SRE: SLOs, monitoring, alerting, toil reduction and simplicity 

## Chapter 2 - Implementing SLOs

## Chapter 3 - SLO Engineering Case Studies

## Chapter 4 - Monitoring

## Chapter 5 - Alerting on SLOs

## Chapter 7 - Simplicity

# Part II - Practices

## Chapter 8 - On-Call

## Chapter 9 - Incident Response

## Chapter 10 - Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure

## Chapter 11 - Managing Load

## Chapter 12 - Introducing Non-Abstract Large System Design
- Google: "We consider reliability to be the most critical feature of any production system"
- The principles at the beginning of the chapter are cool
    - You should write about those!
- But then the chapter goes on to explain complex application/system design that has like 100TB of data processed by day. Not sure if it's a weird flex from the authors, but kinda hard to take action points from the example provided
    - Maybe if you really dig into it you can extract more info though

## Chapter 13 - Data Processing Pipelines

## Chapter 15 - Configuration Specifics

## Chapter 16 - Canarying Releases

# Part III - Processes

## Chapter 17 - Identifying and Recovering from Overload

## Chapter 18 - SRE Engagement Model
- This seemed interesting with useful information on how to engage on project development and talking to other teams

## Chapter 20 - SRE Team Lifecycles

## Chapter 21 - Organizational Change Management in SRE
