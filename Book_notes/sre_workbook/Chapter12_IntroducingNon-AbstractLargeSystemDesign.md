## Chapter 12 - Introducing Non-Abstract Large System Design
- Google: "We consider reliability to be the most critical feature of any production system"
- The principles at the beginning of the chapter are cool
    - You should write about those!
- But then the chapter goes on to explain complex application/system design that has like 100TB of data processed by day. Not sure if it's a weird flex from the authors, but kinda hard to take action points from the example provided. If you look hard enough maybe there are guidelines in there on how to architect and estimate big systems? Maybe if you really dig into it you can extract good, actionable information
