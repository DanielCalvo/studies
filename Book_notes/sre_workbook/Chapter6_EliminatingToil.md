## Chapter 6 - Eliminating Toil

### What is Toil?
- Manual, repetitive, automatable, reactive, lacking enduring value, grows as fast as it's source (ex: disk full alerts grow with server numbers)
- Toil can deflate team morale
- Fix the root problem when possible: You can write a script to delete log files, but if you can stop generating overly verbose useless logs in the first place, that's better

### Measuring toil
- Stopped on page 94
- This chapter is really cool though, I should continue until they go with those examples at google, the principles until then are awesome!
