# PART ONE - LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES
# SECTION 1 - FOUNDATIONS

# First platoon: Detach
- By stepping back, you can detach yourself from the immediate problem, and see a solution with more clarity
- This can be useful specially if a situation is chaotic.

# Second platoon: Arrogance and humility
- The first leader Jocko had was arrogant, had a big ego and did not listen. This did not go well.
- The second leader (DC) was experienced and executed descentralized command: 
    - "Hey, here's the mission for tonight. Figure out how you think we should do it and let me know" 
- DC would later detach from the planning process and help them review the mission plans
- DC would allow the team to come up with their own plan and have complete ownership of it. Of course the team would buy into their own plan!
- If the team doesn't have ownership and buy of the plan, and the plan comes from someone else, people will just blame whoever created the plan
- Without everyone buying into the plan, taking ownership and making every possible effort to ensure it was carried out and mission accomplished, there was a good chance the plan would fail
- DC was also humble and took out the trash at the end of the day. He was not above this task. This left a positive impression on Jocko and earned him respect
- The core of what DC taught Jocko was the importance of humility

# Third platoon: Overstepping my bounds
- It is your job to support the team and the mission, which means supporting the boss
- Even though you have to be ready to lead, you also have to be ready to follow
- To be a good leader, you must also be a good follower
- Subordinate your ego to the mission and the boss. Put the team and the mission first so you can win

# Laws of combat and principles of leadership
- Keep it simple is also a principle of combat, ha
- Cover and move, hmm. I wonder how that applies to other fields. Looks like a broad interpretation of this is "work together" and "support each other"
- Prioritize and execute. You can try to do too many things at once and accomplish nothing. Find your biggest priority and execute a plan to fix the problem
    - On keeping it simple: If under duress, be careful not to make your communication too complex
- Descentralized command: People or sub-teams need to understand the broad direction from the boss, and they neex to act!

The laws of combat and the principles of leadership are:
- Cover and move 
- Keep it simple
- Prioritize and Execute
- Descentralized Command

## Cover and move
- Two teams covering and moving for each other don't just double their effectiveness, their effectiveness multiplies

## Simple
- Goals must be simple
- Directives must communicated up and down the chain of command in a simple, clear and concise manner that can be understood by all

## Prioritize and execute
- There are multiple things to accomplish at once. If you try to do too many at once, you won't accomplish any of them
- The most impactful task or the biggest problem must be addressed first

## Decentralized command
- Everyone on the team must be able to step up and lead
- "What if everyone working with you knew your intent and what you wanted to accomplish, and they took initiative to make that plan come to fruition?"
- However, all of this depends on the commander clearly conveying their intent, only of other people understand your intent can they execute anything
- And the execution hinges on other's confidence to make decisions with the level of empowerment they have
    - Only of others feel empowered they would make things happen, step up and lead

---

These laws are easy to understand, but not always easy to implement.
There are however two more components of leadership:

## Extreme Ownership
- Extreme ownership is a mindset of not making excuses or casting blame when problems occur
- Instead, good leaders and good teams take ownership of those problems, find solutions and implement those solutions
- Failure to take ownership results in problems never being solved and teams never improving

## Dichotomy of leadership
- To properly lead, a leader must be balanced
- Any trait, technique or attitude can easily go too far in one direction
- For instance: Leader must talk. But if they talk too much, they overwhelm others with information. If they talk too little, others may not be properly informed
- A leader must be aggressive, but if they're too aggressive, they might expose themselves to unnecessary risks. However, if they're not aggressive enough, they'll never make progress
