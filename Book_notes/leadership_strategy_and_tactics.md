# PART ONE - LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES
# SECTION 1 - FOUNDATIONS

# First platoon: Detach
- By stepping back, you can detach yourself from the immediate problem, and see a solution with more clarity
- This can be useful specially if a situation is chaotic.

# Second platoon: Arrogance and humility
- The first leader Jocko had was arrogant, had a big ego and did not listen. This did not go well.
- The second leader (DC) was experienced and executed descentralized command: 
    - "Hey, here's the mission for tonight. Figure out how you think we should do it and let me know" 
- DC would later detach from the planning process and help them review the mission plans
- DC would allow the team to come up with their own plan and have complete ownership of it. Of course the team would buy into their own plan!
- If the team doesn't have ownership and buy of the plan, and the plan comes from someone else, people will just blame whoever created the plan
- Without everyone buying into the plan, taking ownership and making every possible effort to ensure it was carried out and mission accomplished, there was a good chance the plan would fail
- DC was also humble and took out the trash at the end of the day. He was not above this task. This left a positive impression on Jocko and earned him respect
- The core of what DC taught Jocko was the importance of humility

# Third platoon: Overstepping my bounds
- It is your job to support the team and the mission, which means supporting the boss
- Even though you have to be ready to lead, you also have to be ready to follow
- To be a good leader, you must also be a good follower
- Subordinate your ego to the mission and the boss. Put the team and the mission first so you can win

# Laws of combat and principles of leadership
- Keep it simple is also a principle of combat, ha
- Cover and move, hmm. I wonder how that applies to other fields. Looks like a broad interpretation of this is "work together" and "support each other"
- Prioritize and execute. You can try to do too many things at once and accomplish nothing. Find your biggest priority and execute a plan to fix the problem
    - On keeping it simple: If under duress, be careful not to make your communication too complex
- Descentralized command: People or sub-teams need to understand the broad direction from the boss, and they neex to act!

The laws of combat and the principles of leadership are:
- Cover and move 
- Keep it simple
- Prioritize and Execute
- Descentralized Command

## Cover and move
- Two teams covering and moving for each other don't just double their effectiveness, their effectiveness multiplies

## Simple
- Goals must be simple
- Directives must communicated up and down the chain of command in a simple, clear and concise manner that can be understood by all

## Prioritize and execute
- There are multiple things to accomplish at once. If you try to do too many at once, you won't accomplish any of them
- The most impactful task or the biggest problem must be addressed first

## Decentralized command
- Everyone on the team must be able to step up and lead
- "What if everyone working with you knew your intent and what you wanted to accomplish, and they took initiative to make that plan come to fruition?"
- However, all of this depends on the commander clearly conveying their intent, only of other people understand your intent can they execute anything
- And the execution hinges on other's confidence to make decisions with the level of empowerment they have
    - Only of others feel empowered they would make things happen, step up and lead

---

These laws are easy to understand, but not always easy to implement.
There are however two more components of leadership:

## Extreme Ownership
- Extreme ownership is a mindset of not making excuses or casting blame when problems occur
- Instead, good leaders and good teams take ownership of those problems, find solutions and implement those solutions
- Failure to take ownership results in problems never being solved and teams never improving

## Dichotomy of leadership
- To properly lead, a leader must be balanced
- Any trait, technique or attitude can easily go too far in one direction
- For instance: Leader must talk. But if they talk too much, they overwhelm others with information. If they talk too little, others may not be properly informed
- A leader must be aggressive, but if they're too aggressive, they might expose themselves to unnecessary risks. However, if they're not aggressive enough, they'll never make progress

# Leaders Tell the Truth

# SECTION 2 - CORE TENETS

# Be Capable and Ask for Help
# Building Trust and Relationships
Relationships are based on trust. Teams are built on relationships

The most obvious way of building trust is honesty. To build trust you have to give trust.

The author allows subordinates to run missions as beginners to increase trust both ways. If the subordinate is successful, trust increases. If the subordinate fails this is an opportunity to teach, council and mentor them. The more trust is built the more hands off the leader can be.

## Up the chain
To build trust up the chain, first of all, tell the truth. Make sure you tell the truth about things the boss needs to know. Small things might not matter. Performing well and being tactful when pushing back are also important to build trust up the chain.

## Trust and decentralized command
Communication up and down the chain of command is important. A leader might not be able to see what a subordinate sees.
A leader can make bad decisions because of their lack of perspective. Therefore it is essential that open dialogue takes place.
However some situations are emergencies and there are there is no time for dialogue. This is when having trust is essential

# Earning influence and Respect
# Extreme Ownership in Everything
# Picking up Brass
- Leaders might be above their peers in rank, but they are not superior to those under them in the chain of command                                                            
- No job is too small or menial for a leader to do. Even if it requires no leadership and no skills
- Picking up brass casings with the troops (aka doing a menial job with the team) will build relationships, let you learn how others interact, and prove your humility to them
- This doesn't mean you should always be in the trenches. But if a job is taxing, hard or causes discomfort, you should occasionally join and take part in it
- This will help you to not lose respect in the job itself, and will make your teammates recognize your willingness to should some of the burden of the job

# Leading from the Rear
# Don't Overreact
# Don't care
# Everyone is the Same, Everyone is Different
# Let nature Work
# Isolation as a leader
# Know what is important and what isn't

# SECTION 3 - PRINCIPLES
# The Most Important Member of the Team
- Jocko explained to everyone in the team how their job was important: The frontman, the radioman, the medic, machine gunners and so on
- This should be your attitude: Make every person understand how their job is critical, and how it fits into the big picture and the strategic mission. Everyone has an important job
# Span of Control
# Taking Care of Your People with Discipline
# Imposed Discipline
# Pride
# Giving Orders
# Yes-Men
# The Exception to no bad teams, only bad leaders

# PART TWO: LEADERSHIP TACTICS
# SECTION 1 - BECOMING A LEADER
# How to Succeed as a New Leader
1. Be humble
2. Don't act like you know everything
3. Listen
4. Treat people with respect
5. Take ownership of failures and mistakes
6. Pass credit up and down the chain
7. Work hard
8. Have integrity
9. Be balanced. Extreme actions and opinions are usually not good
10. Be decisive
11. Build relationships. This is your main goal
12. Get the job done. You lead the team in accomplishing the mission. If you don't accomplish the mission, you fail as a leader

These rules are simple, but can be hard to remember and implement. 

Sometimes you might have to jump into positions in which you don't have the knowledge or the experience. That's okay, you just got here!
- However, try to be as prepared as possible 

# How to be Chosen to Lead
# When You Are Not Chosen
# Imposter Syndrome

# Transitioning from Follower to peed to leader
- Watch your attitude. Be the guy who steps up and does his best, not the "looks like I'm responsible for all the crap now" guy

When you become a leader, it doesn't mean you have to lay down the law, or know everything, but it means you have to: 
- Come up with a plan
- Give simple, clear, concise direction
- Stay humble, take input and listen
- And of course, lead!

Once you step up into a leadership position you might have to stop doing some things that you're comfortable doing, and start doing some that you are uncomfortable with!

As a leader, your goal should be to look up and out, not down and into your team.
- The goal is to guide the development of the plan but also its execution. Jocko says the leader should not be doing much of the doing, but on this one I'm gonna go with a "it depends"


# Overcoming a Grudge
# Don't go Overboard, Rambo

# SECTION 2 - LEADERSHIP SKILLS
# When to step up and lead
# Don't Take Things Personally
# Don't Dig In
# Iterative Decision Making
# Descentralized command or lazy designation?
# The Easy Button
# Judging Reputations
# Conform to Influence
# Everything Is Good (But not that good)

# SECTION 3 - MANEUVERS
# Using leadership to teach and build
# Leading Peers
- First of all, put your ego in check 
- One of the best ways to do this and start building a relationship with your peers is to support their ideas
- They might come up with a plan that is different than yours, but if it'll get the job done, support it. Let them take the lead
- Even if you think your idea is better, if their idea is close, go with it. Their dedication to their plan will be far larger than to your plan
- Once you accept their plan, this will show that you're open to ideas, and in most cases, they'll listen to your ideas as well
- If their ideas have shortfalls, explain them and help your team members improve upon them. Give credit to your peers, even if you helped

- When its time to assing tasks, you should jump on the hard ones. If there's extra work to be done, get it done
- But don't overvolunteer, pay attention to how other people react, you don't wanna step on their toes
- When things go wrong, take responsability and get them fixed

- If one of your peers has too much ego and tries to make himself look good, don't fall for the ego trap. Continue to do great work and put the mission first

As you put the mission and the team before yourself and keep your ego in check, you will begin to form relationships with your peers. This is the goal. If you have a relationship with your peers, you can influence them. That is leadership.

Jocko likes to play a game of "who would you hire?"
- The guy who blames everyone else for the problems (the contractors, the weather, the schedule, etc)
- Or the guy who takes ownership: (a guy who lists the mistakes he made, and says how he's going to correct them next time)

The guy who takes ownership and gets problems solved is the one who gets promoted to the next level of leadership.

Don't blame your peers to try to make yourself look good. Put your ego in check, 

- Do the right things for the right reasons
- Support your peers
- Stay humble
- Take ownership of problems
- Pass credit to the team
- Build relationships


# Micromanaging, Indecisive or weak bosses
# When to Micromanage
# The boss wants all the credit
# The nearly indefensible leader
# Stress relief
- Almost every job has a level of stress associated with it
- If you build a relationship with the people you work with, they'll tell you if they're stressed. Or you'll notice
- If people need a break, let them have one. Its important

# Punishment
# When to quit
- By not quitting is how you get through seal training
- No matter how hard it is, how tired, sore, frustrated, exhausted, or otherwise broken you are, you don't quit 
- When a plan is ineffective, its okay to quit, return to base, rest, reformulate the plan and take another shot at it 
- Maybe quitting is the wrong word: Its okay to retreat. You're giving up on one approach to try another.
- It is okay to quit a tactical objective. But you don't quit the strategic mission

# # # SECTION 4 - COMMUNICATION
# Keep the troops informed
# Rumor Control
# Clear Guidance
# Because I said So
# The thread of why
# Tactfully delivering the truth
# Balancing Praise
# Hope
# Ultimatums
# Reflect and Diminish
# When to Yell at Subordinates
# Getting People To Listen
# Apologizing
- There's nothing wrong with apologizing if you made a mistake. That's part of taking ownership.
- If you're apologizing because of a decision that was made, explain what you did, how you read the situation, how you antecipated things to work out, and what actually happened. And how you'll prevent yourself from making the same mistake again!
- Jocko thinks maybe he got as far as he got due to his owning mistakes, the mistakes of others and apologizing 
# Be approacable but careful with words
- Develop a good relationship with everyone in the chain of command.
- As a leader, be careful with your words. Gossip, sarcasm and disrespectful remarks carry too much weight when being thrown around by a leader
- Even legitimate criticism needs to be delivered with caution. Remember that criticism must be constructive.
- Positive remarks can incite enthusiasm, but negative remarks can crush people. Be judicious with your words.

# Set the Example
- If you're a leader, the team is watching you. They watch and notice your attitude. They watch your behaviour and they don't miss a thing
- On top of that, team members will imitate what they see. If you break the rules, they'll break the rules and so on
- They will also conciously or unconsciously mimic your emotions. If you panic, they'll panic. If you stay calm, they will
- Subordinates take notes and discuss the leader behaviour among themselves. If you make a mistake, own it. Explain what you did and how you'll prevent it from happening again
- As a leader, remember you're being watched. Set the example

# CONCLUSION - ITS ALL ON YOU, BUT NOT ABOUT YOU
