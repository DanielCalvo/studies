## Chapter 1
Getting things done requires two basic components defining:
1. What done means (outcome)
2. What going looks like (action)

## Chapter 2
1. Capture what has our attention
2. Clarify what each item means and what to do with it
3. Organize the results
4. Reflect on (?)
5. Engage with (?)


### Capture
- You need to capture everything that's in your head and write it down.
- This means everything that have to do or at least decide about, so at some point in the future you can process and review all of it

- Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your read
- You must have as few capturing buckets as you can get by
- You must empty them regularly (oof)

### Clarify
Is it actionable?
- If no:
    - It's thrash, no longer needed
    - No action needed now, but something might need to be done later (incubate)
    - The item is potentially useful information that might be needed for something later (reference)

- If yes, two things need to be determined about each actionable item
    - What project our outcome have you committed to?
    - What's the next action required?

### Organize
Project: Any desired result that can be accomplished within a year and takes more than one action step
- A project list is a useful thing to have!

The calendar is the place to keep actions that you must take on a specific day, or things you need to know on a specific day
The calendar is sacred territory. What you put there must be done that day. Don't dilute it.

You can have a Someday Maybe list of projects you might want to do in the future. Review this list periodically

Reference can be... general reference or organized by topic/area. Hmm

### Reflect

Personal organizational system as suggested: Projects list, a calendar, next actions list and a waiting for list.

Weekley review: Critical for success!
- All of your projects, active project plans, next actions, agendas, wainting fors and somedays maybes should be reviewed once a week!

The weekly review is the time to
- Gather and process all of your stuff
- Review your system
- Update your lists
- Get clean, clear, current and complete!

### Engage
Hmm, looks like engage is the doing part!
It's a given time! How do you decide what to do?
There are four criteria you can apply: Context, time available, energy available and priority

- Context: It seems this is where you are, geographically. This doesn't seem to matter that much to your remote life
- Time available: How long have you got? Can't do much right 5 min before a meeting
- Energy available: How much energy do you have? Some tasks require lots of energy, others not so much
- Priority: Given the 3 prior factors, what action will give you the highest payoff?
    - You need to use your intuition and make judgement call. 

#### When you're doing work, there are 3 types of work you can be engaged in
- Predefined work: You're working from your next actions, calendars and items that you have previously determined need to be done
- Work as it shows up: Things that come up ad-hoc
- Defining work: Processing your inputs and organizing them so you can go back to predefined work

#### The six level model for reviewing your work

- Horizon 5: Purpose and principles
- Horizon 4: Vision
- Horizon 3: Goals
- Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities
- Horizon 1: Current projects
- Ground: Current actions

Ground: Current actions
- Your next actions

Horizon 1: Current projects
- Your projects on your plate

Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities
- Key areas within your life and work within which you want to achieve results
- Not things to finish, but rather criteria for assessing our experiences and engagements

Horizon 3: Goals
- What you want to be experiencing in various areas of you life one to two years from now.

Horizon 4: Vision
- Categories that fit... within 3 to 5 years?
- Career, family, financial and quality-of-life aspirations

Horizon 5: Purpose and principles
- Big picture. Why does your company exist? Why do you exist?
- What really matters to you, no matter what?
