On Adding value
All production flows have a basic characteristic: The material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process.

A boiled egg is more valuable than a raw one, only assemble breakfast is more valuable than its parts. The breakfast placed in front of the customer is more valuable still.

Technical equivalent: A finished compiler is more valuable than its constituent parts of semantic analysis, code gener and run time.


Tracing a parallel to the work you do: Delivering a monitoring solution is more valuable than just writing a single monitor?

Another cool insight: Always try to detect and fix the problem in a production process at the lowest value stage possible.
Huh, it's like shift left on security: Easier to implenet in the beginning rather than later once things have been redone!

The book that says: You should find a rotten egg in your breakfast factory as it's being delivered from the supplier rather than permitting the customer to find it.

- Cool parallel: So its like writing software tests to ensure you find the problem before your customer finds it!

Chapter 2: Changing the breakfast Factory
Pairing indicators seems like an interesting concept. You can track inventory sizes and then track shortages, to make sure that your inventory is not too lean.

So you could track... fe√¶tures delivered, but also outages in production? Hmm but these two are not the best.
maybe tickets resolved AND satisfied customers? So if you just close tickers too fast, customers won't be too happy.

Author really likes staggered charts, though these seem more relevant in manufacturing? Software is difficult to predict linearly

As a technical lead, are you the most leverage to execute your work?.
It could be writing documents in collaboration with other people.

If I were to share what makes working in events and our culture so great, what would that be?
